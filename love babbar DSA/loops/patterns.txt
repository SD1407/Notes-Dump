in pattern problems we hv to think and observe properly .. we need to check he number of rows and no. of cloumns for each row first..

* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
for this kind of pattern we are observing that we have 4 rows and for each rows we have columns exactly same number of rows ..(this approach is very important) [BASICALLY COUNTING IN TERMS OF ROW]
we will have 2 integers i & j .. one integer i will go for row (like it will trace all the rows one by one) & one integer we have j that will move horizontally for each row no. of times equal to row.. and we will make the pattern.. (remember we need to have '\n' after one full row done..)

always observe the terms related to index number 
for 
1        i=1
2 3      i=2
3 4 5    i=3
4 5 6 7  i=4
 for this kind of pattern we should observe the pattern with respect to the index number it will be easier to observe and make a formula out of that.. 

for patterns like 
A A A
B B B
C C C 
we use ASCII numbers and add them as integers and then convert them to characters and print them further

like char = 'A' + 1;
this will give us B;

now its time for space and star problems .... 
here we r gonna use more than one loop inside one loop for printing space .. stars and numbers separetely .. we are going to break the structure into few parts and we r gonna make loops for each and every part and print it ...

_ _ _ *
_ _ * *
_ * * *
* * * *   // for this kind of pattern where "_" is space ... we are gonna break it to 2 different parts one for the spaces to print and one for the stars ... (we need 2 loops inside a loop)

_ _ _ 1
_ _ 1 2 1
_ 1 2 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 3 2 1   // here we have 3 triangles one for space one for numbers and other for another number

_ _ _     1    
_ _     1 2    1    
_     1 2 3    2 1 
    1 2 3 4    3 2 1     
 
these are the 3 triangles...  (remember we have a loop[the outmost] for row wise traverse )

break the patterns and print through loops...(dont forget the fundamentals basically we have to think like row and cloumns first)
