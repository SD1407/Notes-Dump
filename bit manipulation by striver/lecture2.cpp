// q1 // we have given n integers every integers appears twice but only two integers are appearing once // tell the integers // in GFG is there

// q2 // we have given an array of N integers so we need to print the XOR of all the subsets.
// the XOR of all will be 0 only (as by default every element will come twice )

// q3 // generating all the subsets
