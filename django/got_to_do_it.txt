 ---- APIs ---- 
For apis creation we can use function base apis or class based apis, for class based apis, we have Django-restframework generics, the best and powerful method to make a CRUD API

Doc link : https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/

 ---- Django Filters ----
    
    // READ the documentation in detail, also if want to revise it quick check the oh-api code base, there is methods which we can define for looking for the filters and also what value should we retrieve after we got the filter, like for schedule task CB-305, I have added the level field and also how to filter the queryset with that field, like 'batch__level__" etc etc so check that from oh-api and we can surely create our method and define it inside the level field which you have added
